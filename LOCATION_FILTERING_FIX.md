# Location Filtering Fix Implementation

## Problem
The task feed was showing tasks regardless of distance because location filtering only applied when `maxDistance` query parameter was explicitly provided. Without this parameter, no location filtering occurred at all.

**Example Issue:**
- Tasker location: `9.082, 8.6753` (Nigeria)
- Task location: `36.2048, 138.2529` (Japan)  
- Distance: ~7,000+ miles
- Result: Task appeared in feed (incorrect)

## Root Cause
The original condition was:
```javascript
if (req.query.maxDistance && tasker.location && tasker.location.latitude && tasker.location.longitude)
```

This meant location filtering was **ONLY** applied when `maxDistance` was explicitly provided in the query.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Location Utilities (`utils/locationUtils.js`)
- **Haversine formula** for accurate distance calculation
- **Helper functions** for unit conversion (miles â†” meters)
- **Distance validation** functions

### 2. Updated Task Controller (`controllers/task-controller.js`)
- **Always apply location filtering** when tasker has location (default 200 miles)
- **Two-stage filtering**:
  1. MongoDB bounding box (performance optimization)
  2. Precise distance calculation using Haversine formula
- **Comprehensive logging** for debugging
- **Changed condition** to:
  ```javascript
  if (tasker.location && tasker.location.latitude && tasker.location.longitude)
  ```

### 3. Enhanced Filtering Process
1. **Bounding Box Filtering** (MongoDB level)
   - Quick elimination of obviously distant tasks
   - Performance optimization for large datasets

2. **Precise Distance Filtering** (Application level)
   - Uses Haversine formula for accurate calculation
   - Filters tasks based on actual distance
   - Logs each task's distance and inclusion status

## Key Changes

### Before:
- Location filtering only when `maxDistance` query provided
- Simple bounding box approximation only
- No debugging information

### After:
- Location filtering always applied when tasker has location
- Default 200-mile radius (configurable via `maxDistance`)
- Two-stage filtering (bounding box + precise distance)
- Comprehensive logging for debugging
- Accurate Haversine distance calculation

## Testing
With the fix:
- Tasks beyond the specified radius (default 200 miles) will be excluded
- Distance calculations are accurate using proper spherical geometry
- Debug logs show exact distances and filtering decisions

## Files Modified
1. `utils/locationUtils.js` - NEW (location calculation utilities)
2. `controllers/task-controller.js` - Modified (enhanced location filtering)

## API Behavior
- **Default**: 200-mile radius for taskers with location
- **Configurable**: `?maxDistance=100` to set custom radius
- **Backward Compatible**: Works with existing code
- **Performance**: Optimized with two-stage filtering
